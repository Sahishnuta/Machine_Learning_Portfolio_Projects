## [Project 1: Chat Analysis of WhatsApp messages](https://github.com/Sahishnuta/Machine_Learning-projects/tree/main/Chat_Analysis)

In this project, I analyzed and visualized the insights of the chat data. The data is sourced from a group that I was part of. I just downloaded the chat as a text file from WhatsApp.

## [Project 2: Classification of the Higgs Bosons](https://github.com/Sahishnuta/Machine_Learning-projects/tree/main/Higgs_Boson_Analytics)

This project aims to distinguish between a signal process that produces Higgs bosons and a background process that does not.

## [Project 3: Merchant Fraud Detection](https://github.com/Sahishnuta/Machine_Learning-projects/tree/main/Merchant%20Fraud%20Detection)

This project aims to detect whether fraud is committed by the merchant or not using machine learning techniques based on the details of the merchant, customer and order placed by the customer.

## [Project 4: Customer Value Prediction](https://github.com/Sahishnuta/Machine_Learning-projects/tree/main/PHD_Customer_Value_Prediction)

This project calculates “Customer Lifetime Value” with a proprietary formula to drive marketing decisions and customer relationship management.

## [Project 5:  Retail Demand Prediction](https://github.com/Sahishnuta/Machine_Learning-projects/tree/main/Retail_demand_Prediction)

This project aims to prevent the overstocking and understocking of goods for retailers based on store information, product information and sales of the products.

## [Project 6:  Road Traffic Severity Classification](https://github.com/Sahishnuta/Machine_Learning-projects/tree/main/Road_Traffic_Severity_Classification)

This project aims to prevent the overstocking and understocking of goods for retailers based on store information, product information and sales of the products.

## [Project 7:  Site Energy Usage Intensity Prediction](https://github.com/Sahishnuta/Machine_Learning-projects/tree/main/Site_Energy_Usage_Intensity_Prediction)

This project aim to prevent the overstocking and understocking of goods for retailers based on store information, product information and sales of the products.

## [Project 8:  Wild BlueBerry Yield Production](https://github.com/Sahishnuta/Machine_Learning-projects/tree/main/Wild%20Blueberry%20Yield%20Production)

This projects aim to prevent the overstocking and understocking of goods for retailers based on store information, product information and sales of the products.
